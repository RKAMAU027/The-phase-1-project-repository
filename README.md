PROJECT OVERVIEW 
In this project, we are able to analyze the data provided in order to recommend the movies to Microsoft.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

DATA SETS USED
imdb.title.basics
imdb.title.ratings
bom.movie_gross
We analyze the data and compare it to get the genre with the highest rating in order to recommend it.

CONCLUSION
We recommend that microsoft should invest in 	Action, Adventure, Drama because they have the highest rating.
